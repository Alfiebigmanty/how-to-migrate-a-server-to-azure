Before initiating any migration, it is essential to understand the existing environment. Begin with a comprehensive inventory and assessment:

Identify all running services: DHCP, DNS, IIS/Web servers, VPN endpoints, custom business apps, and SMB file shares.

Use Azure Migrate, Microsoft‚Äôs assessment tool, to scan your servers and dependencies. This tool helps visualize which workloads can be moved to Platform as a Service (PaaS) and which require Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

Establish service interdependencies (e.g., app servers depending on DNS or file storage).

Define uptime requirements for each service, identifying high-availability needs and acceptable downtime thresholds.

Plan for Identity integration by determining whether on-premises Active Directory will be extended to Azure or replaced.

This phase sets the foundation and helps design a right-sized Azure environment that aligns with business needs.

üåê Phase 2: Network and Identity Foundation
A secure and resilient Azure infrastructure begins with the network topology and identity services.

1. Virtual Network Setup
Create an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to simulate your on-premise network layout. Subnets should be segmented by role:

DMZ Subnet for public-facing apps or web servers

Internal Subnet for DNS, DHCP (if required), and applications

Storage Subnet for file storage access

Apply Network Security Groups (NSGs) to restrict traffic per subnet.

2. Site-to-Site VPN
Set up a Site-to-Site VPN Gateway to connect Azure with your on-premises network. This ensures hybrid operation during migration and supports fallback or dual usage during cutover.

3. Identity Synchronization
Deploy Azure AD Connect to sync on-prem Active Directory users to Azure Active Directory (AAD).

Set up Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AAD DS) to provide domain join, group policy, and LDAP support for workloads that require traditional domain-based authentication.

These steps create a hybrid identity environment necessary for smooth workload migration and post-migration operations.

üß± Phase 3: Core Services Deployment (DNS, DHCP, VPN, File)
1. DNS Migration
Azure DNS can be used to manage external DNS zones. Internal name resolution can be handled in one of two ways:

Windows DNS VM running on Azure, configured to use AD-integrated zones

Azure VNet's custom DNS configuration, pointing to this VM or hybrid resolver

To minimize disruption:

Set low TTLs (e.g., 5 minutes) on current DNS records before cutover

During cutover, point clients to the new DNS server IPs on Azure

2. DHCP Setup
Azure doesn't natively support DHCP in the traditional Windows sense. However, most of the IP assignment inside VNets is handled by Azure itself. For hybrid or VM-intensive environments:

Deploy a Windows Server VM running DHCP in a dedicated subnet.

Scope design should avoid conflicts with Azure-assigned ranges.

Optionally, keep DHCP services on-premises during the initial hybrid phase.

3. VPN Migration
Migrate VPN functionality to Azure VPN Gateway. Configure:

Point-to-site for individual clients

Site-to-site for permanent on-prem connectivity

Test VPN access thoroughly and ensure all routing policies are updated in firewalls or NSGs to allow traffic.

4. File Services Migration
Azure offers several file storage options:

Azure Files with AD authentication for cloud-native SMB file sharing.

Use Azure File Sync to keep your on-premise file server and Azure Files synchronized, allowing gradual migration.

Apply access controls using Azure AD DS-integrated NTFS permissions.

This hybrid approach allows users to continue accessing files without disruption.

üíª Phase 4: Application and Web Server Migration
1. Internal and External Web Servers
Depending on the application type, there are several options:

Azure App Service: Ideal for .NET, PHP, Node.js, Java apps.

Supports staging slots for zero-downtime deployment.

Integrated VNet support allows backend access.

Azure Front Door or Application Gateway:

For external web services, provides global load balancing and Web Application Firewall (WAF) features.

Can handle HTTPS termination, DDoS protection, and performance routing.

Apps not compatible with PaaS can be lifted-and-shifted to Windows/Linux VMs within the VNet.

2. Business Applications
Evaluate compatibility with App Service, containers, or Azure Virtual Machines.

Use Azure Migrate: App Containerization if suitable.

For legacy apps, a dedicated VM may be more appropriate initially, with long-term modernization goals.

üß™ Phase 5: Testing and Validation
Before executing the final migration:

Test each service in isolation and in integrated workflows.

Validate identity authentication (NTLM/Kerberos), file access, DHCP lease assignment, DNS resolution, VPN tunnels, and app performance.

Run failover scenarios, such as disconnecting on-prem DNS or DHCP to simulate a full cloud takeover.

Ensure monitoring is active:

Set up Azure Monitor and Log Analytics to track key metrics.

Define alerts for service downtime or unusual network activity.

üïê Phase 6: Final Cutover and Post-Migration Optimization
Final Cutover
Schedule the cutover during a low-traffic window.

Migrate file shares with Storage Migration Service or copy final deltas via Robocopy or AzCopy.

Point DHCP clients to new scopes (or let Azure assign IPs natively).

Update DNS records or zones to Azure DNS and set TTLs back to production values.

Swap production slots in App Service for web apps.

Post-Migration
Decommission unused on-prem infrastructure.

Perform backup configuration with Azure Backup.

Optimize costs using Azure Cost Management + Reservations for long-term discounts.

Document new architecture and update IT playbooks.

üí∏ Cost Planning
The following table provides a monthly estimate for a medium-sized deployment (USD):

Component	Azure Service	Monthly Estimate
VPN Gateway	VpnGw1	$140
DNS Hosting	Azure DNS	$5
DHCP Server	Windows Server VM (B2ms)	$70
Web Apps	App Service Plan (P1V2)	$75
External Web Gateway	Azure Front Door + WAF	$120
App Servers	2 VMs or App Service (medium)	$140
File Storage	Azure Files (1TB, LRS)	$50
AD Services	Azure AD DS	$110
Logging/Monitoring	Azure Monitor (5 GB/day)	$50
Backup	Azure Backup (500 GB)	$25
Total Monthly Cost		~$685

Assumes Azure Hybrid Benefit (existing Windows licenses) and moderate usage.

üß† Conclusion
Migrating essential infrastructure services to Azure demands meticulous planning, structured execution, and continuous validation. Microsoft provides a mature ecosystem of services‚Äîsuch as Azure App Service, Azure DNS, Azure VPN Gateway, and Azure Files‚Äîthat replicate and improve upon traditional on-premise roles.

By adopting a phased, hybrid migration approach, organizations can maintain operational continuity, minimize service disruption, and gradually modernize their IT footprint for better agility and resilience in the cloud.
